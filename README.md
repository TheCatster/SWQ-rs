## About SWQ-rs
Use your terminal often, and really want to grab that perfect quote or GIF for the situation? SWQ has you covered! It's easy to use, and quickly adds a GIF or full quote (with or without author) to your clipboard. SWQ-rs is a rewrite of the original Python+fire into Rust+clap for a faster, and more efficient codebase.

## Usage

- swq quote KEYWORDS

- swq gif KEYWORDS

That's it!

## Installation

A Tenor API key is recommended, to get one please go to [Tenor API](https://tenor.com/gifapi), and on first time use of the GIF command, it will prompt you to paste it in (the key is held in the keyring).

## To-Do:

- [x] Get quotes

- [x] Get GIFs (from Tenor)

- [x] Auto add to clipboard

- [ ] Add quotes

- [ ] TBD!
