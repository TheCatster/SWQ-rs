"\"I find your lack of faith disturbing.\"\n\tDarth Vader"
"\"The Force will be with you. Always.\"\n\tObi-Wan Kenobi"
"\"When gone am I, the last of the Jedi will you be. The Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned.\"\n\tYoda"
"\"Just for once, let me look on you with my own eyes.\"\n\tDarth Vader"
"\"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.\"\n\tTitle card"
"\"Someday I will be the most powerful Jedi ever.\"\n\tAnakin Skywalker"
"\"If you strike me down I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.\"\n\tObi-Wan Kenobi"
"\"It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs. I've outrun Imperial starships. Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships, now. She's fast enough for you, old man.\"\n\tHan Solo"
"\"Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger; anger leads to hate; hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you.\"\n\tYoda"
"\"Luke, you can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and together we can rule the galaxy as father and son.\"\n\tDarth Vader"
"\"At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will have revenge.\"\n\tDarth Maul"
"\"I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.\"\n\tDarth Vader"
"\"Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.\"\n\tYoda"
"\"It's a trap!\"\n\tAdmiral Ackbar"
"\"No. I am your father.\"\n\tDarth Vader"
"\"I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be.\"\n\tObi-Wan Kenobi"
"\"Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.\"\n\tDarth Vader"
"\"Now, young Skywalker, you will die.\"\n\tEmperor Palpatine"
"\"Search your feelings, you know you to be true.\"\n\tDarth Vader"
"\"In my experience there is no such thing as luck.\"\n\tObi-Wan Kenobi"
"\"Be careful not to choke on your aspirations.\"\n\tDarth Vader"
"\"You're coming with me. I'll not leave you here, I've got to save you.\"\n\tLuke Skywalker"
"\"You already have, Luke. You were right. You were right about me.\"\n\tDarth Vader "
"\"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.\"\n\tLeia Organa"
"\"My ally is the Force, and a powerful ally it is.\"\n\tYoda"
"\"You were the chosen one! It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them. You were to bring balance to the force, not leave it in darkness.\"\n\tObi-Wan Kenobi"
"\"So this is how liberty dies. With thunderous applause.\"\n\tPadme Amidala"
"\"Do. Or do not. There is no try.\"\n\tYoda"
"\"I fear nothing. For all is as the Force wills it.\"\n\tChirrut Imwe"
"\"The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.\"\n\tChancellor Palpatine"
"\"Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately 3,720 to 1.\"\n\tC-3P0"
"\"Never tell me the odds!\"\n\tHan Solo"
"\"I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, your highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me.\"\n\tLuke Skywalker"
"\"You can't stop the change, any more than you can stop the suns from setting.\"\n\tShmi Skywalker"
"\"Chewie, we're home.\"\n\tHan Solo"
"\"Hello. I don't believe we have been introduced. R2-D2? A pleasure to meet you. I am C-3PO, Human-Cyborg Relations.\"\n\tC-3PO"
"\"That's no moon. It's a space station.\"\n\tObi-Wan Kenobi"
"\"Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've just about had enough of you. Go that way, you'll be malfunctioning in a day you near-sighted scrap pile.\"\n\tC-3PO"
"\"You serve your master well. And you will be rewarded.\"\n\tLuke Skywalker"
"\"What if I told you that the Republic was now under the control of a Dark Lord of the Sith?\"\n\tCount Dooku"
"\"Oh, my dear friend. How I've missed you.\"\n\tC-3PO"
"\"It's not my fault.\"\n\tHan Solo"
"\"Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is essential to a Jedi's life. So you might say, that we are encouraged to love.\"\n\tAnakin Skywalker"
"\"Sometimes we must let go of our pride and do what is requested of us.\"\n\tPadme Amidala"
"\"The time to fight is now.\"\n\tJyn Erso"
"\"You don't need to see his identification... These aren't the droids you're looking for.\"\n\tObi-Wan Kenobi"
"\"Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease.\"\n\tC-3PO"
"\"Oh no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken, about a great many things.\"\n\tThe Emperor"
"\"Every time I walked away from something I wanted to forget, I told myself it was for a cause that I believed in. A cause that was worth it. Without that, we're lost.\"\n\tCassian Andor"
"\"Always in motion is the future.\"\n\tYoda"
"\"The Sith killed each other, victims of their own greed. But from the ashes of their destruction, I was the last survivor. I chose to pass my knowledge on to only one. I created a legacy so resilient that now you come before me.\"\n\tDarth Bane"
"\"You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I am here to put you back on schedule.\"\n\tDarth Vader"
"\"Women always figure out the truth. Always.\"\n\tHan Solo"
"\"Hmph! Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless!\"\n\tYoda"
"\"Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.\"\n\tYoda"
"\"Many of the truths that we cling to depend on our point of view.\"\n\tObi Wan"
"\"Your focus determines your reality.\"\n\tQui-Gon Jinn"
"\"Something inside me has always been there, but now it's awake.\"\n\tRey"
"\"Somebody has to save our skins.\"\n\tLeia Organa"
"\"Sorry about the mess.\"\n\tHan Solo"
"\"You are unwise to lower your defenses!\"\n\tDarth Vader"
"\"Great, kid. Don't get cocky.\"\n\tHan Solo"
"\"When 900 years old, you reach... Look as good, you will not.\"\n\tYoda"
"\"The Sith took everything from me. Ripped me from my mother's arms, murdered my brother, used me as a weapon, and then cast me aside. Abandoned me. Once, I had power - now I have nothing.\"\n\tDarth Maul"
"\"You don't know how hard I found it, signing the order to terminate your life.\"\n\tGrand Moff Tarkin"
"\"You came in that thing? You're braver than I thought.\"\n\tLeia Organa"
"\"Ahh, hard to see, the Dark Side is.\"\n\tYoda"
"\"Obi-Wan Kenobi. Obi-Wan. Now that's a name I have not heard in a long time. A long time.\"\n\tObi-Wan Kenobi"
"\"Now, be brave and don't look back. Don't look back.\"\n\tShmi Skywalker"
"\"Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?\"\n\tLeia Organa"
"\"Now, witness the power of this fully operational battle station.\"\n\tEmperor Palpatine"
"\"I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate. You have anger. But you don't use them.\"\n\tCount Dooku"
"\"Much to learn you still have... my old Padawan.\"\n\tYoda"
"\"You know, no matter how much we fought, I've always hated watching you leave.\"\n\tLeia Organa"
"\"I'm just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe.\"\n\tJango Fett"
"\"Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.\"\n\tObi-Wan Kenobi"
"\"Mmm. Lost a planet, Master Obi-Wan has. How embarrassing.\"\n\tYoda"
"\"Master Kenobi, you disappoint me. Yoda holds you in such high esteem. Surely you can do better!\"\n\tCount Dooku"
"\"Let the past die. Kill it if you have to.\"\n\tKylo Ren"
"\"Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force.\"\n\tYoda"
"\"Oh my. Space travel sound rather perilous. I can assure you they will never get me on one of those dreadful Star Ships.\"\n\tC-3PO"
"\"He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack.\"\n\tDarth Vader"
"\"There's always a bigger fish.\"\n\tQui Gon Jinn"
"\"May the Force be with you.\"\n\tGeneral Dodonna"
"\"If you define yourself by your power to take life, your desire to dominate, to possess, then you have nothing.\"\n\tObi-Wan Kenobi"
"\"Traveling through hyperspace ain't like dusting crops, farm boy.\"\n\tHan Solo"
"\"Governor Tarkin, I should've expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.\"\n\tLeia Organa"
"\"You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds.\"\n\tLando"
"\"She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.\"\n\tHan Solo"
"\"Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future... but not at the expense of the moment.\"\n\tQui Gon Jinn"
"\"Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.\"\n\tHan Solo"
"\"Would somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?\"\n\tPrincess Leia"
"\"Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.\"\n\tThe Emperor"
"\"When I found you, I saw raw, untamed power, and beyond that, something truly special.\"\n\tSupreme leader Snoke"
"\"Boring conversation anyway. Luke! We're gonna have company!\"\n\tHan Solo"
"\"You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them.\"\n\tPrincess Leia"
"\"Laugh it up, fuzzball!\"\n\tHan Solo"
"\"Judge me by my size, do you?\"\n\tYoda"
"\"I've got a bad feeling about this.\"\n\tHan Solo"
"\"Your weapon... you will not need it.\"\n\tYoda"
"\"The Force is strong with you. A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth... Vader.\"\n\tEmperor Palpatine"
"\"There is no escape! Don't make me destroy you. Luke, you do not yet realize your importance. You've only begun to discover your power!\"\n\tDarth Vader"
"\"Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader.\"\n\tObi-Wan Kenobi"
"\"If there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.\"\n\tLuke Skywalker"
"\"One thing's for sure, we're all going to be a lot thinner.\"\n\tHan Solo"
"\"I think I just blasted it.\"\n\tLuke Skywalker"
"\"Who's the more foolish: the fool, or the fool who follows him?\"\n\tObi-Wan Kenobi"
"\"You will know when you are calm, at peace, passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.\"\n\tYoda"
"\"Someone has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, fly boy.\"\n\tPrincess Leia"
"\"The strongest stars have hearts of kyber.\"\n\tChirrut Imwe"
"\"When you look at the dark side, careful you must be... for the dark side looks back.\"\n\tYoda"
"\"If we can make it to the ground, we'll take the next chance. And the next. On and on until we win... or the chances are spent.\"\n\tJyn Erso"
"\"Wait. Oh my! What have you done? I'm backwards. You flea-bitten furball! Only an overgrown mop-head like you would be stupid enough to...\"\n\tC-3PO"
"\"The ability to speak does not make you intelligent.\"\n\tQui-Gon Jinn"
"\"You don't have to do this to impress me.\"\n\tPrincess Leia"
"\"I assure you, Lord Vader. My men are working as fast as they can.\"\n\tMoff Jerjerrod"
"\"I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears that you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.\"\n\tC-3PO"
"\"I have lived long enough to see the same eyes in different people.\"\n\tMaz Kanata"
"\"Either shut him up or shut him down!\"\n\tHan Solo"
"\"Be mindful of your thoughts Anakin. They'll betray you.\"\n\tObi-Wan Kenobi"
"\"Great shot kid, that was one in a million.\"\n\tHan Solo"
"\"We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life.\"\n\tC-3PO"
"\"I can fix this.\"\n\tPoe Dameron"
"\"He's the brains, sweetheart!\"\n\tHan Solo"
"\"I'm standing by as you requested, although there's a problem on the horizon. There's no horizon.\"\n\tK-2SO"
"\"I wouldn't be nice to you. It doesn't pay much.\"\n\tHan Solo"
"\"Anakin, you're breaking my heart! And you're going down a path I cannot follow!\"\n\tPadme Amidala"
"\"Same thing I always do: talk my way out of it.\"\n\tHan Solo"
"\"I've been running scams on the streets since I was ten. I was kicked out of the flight academy for having a mind of my own. I'm gonna be a pilot. The best in the galaxy.\"\n\tHan Solo"
"\"Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter.\"\n\tYoda"
"\"The force is strong with this one.\"\n\tDarth Vader"
